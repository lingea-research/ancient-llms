I rebuilt from top to bottom the storehouses of my lordly palace which are at the head of the ḫamiluḫḫu and the small terrace (and) which had become dilapidated. I rebuilt the house of the šaḫuruof Erība-Adad (I) and the large terrace  (v 5) on the north side which Aššur-nādin-aḫḫē, king of Assyria, had built (and which) had become dilapidated. I dug out the moat of my city Aššur which had fallen in and become filled with earth from the Craftsman's Gate to the Tigris Gate. I removed the worn doors of the Craftsman's Gate, (v 10) made high doors of fir, (and) made (them) fast with bronze bands. I completely reconstructed the great wall of my city Aššur. I piled up earth around and on top of it. I built the palace of cedar, (v 15) boxwood, terebinth, (and) tamarisk in my city Aššur. I made (replicas of) two nāḫiru, four burḫiš, (and) four lions in basalt, two genii in parūtu-alabaster, (and) two  i{burḫiš} in white limestone and stationed (them) at their doors.
Perhaps I am lagging behind my colleagues; I should inspect my work in Dur-Šarruken.
